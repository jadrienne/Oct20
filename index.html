            </header>

            <p>Bunnytears is a brand of jewelry that caters to most aesthetics. 
                We have recently split ourselves into two brands to cater more to specific needs for our customers. 
                Bunnytears jewelry is for the coquette, soft, cute and dainty aesthetics,
                while Grungetears jewelry is for the grunge and punk aesthetics. </p>

            <p><span class="highlight">As a small business owner, I believe that each piece should be unique
                and OAK (one-of-a-kind) so I create my jewelry by using different patterns, colors, shapes, and themes.

            <p>In terms of ideating designs, I take inspiration from mostly just my beads and themes that l've thought of in my head. 
            When I first started in 2019, I used to go on Pinterest or even take a look at other jewelry creators'
            creations for inspiration when I create. In the long run, I realized that it is simply copying others' ideas 
            and this in turn displays little to no originality and creativity of your own; hence, I decided to just 
            work with what I have such as my imagination; various themes, movies, and songs.</p>
